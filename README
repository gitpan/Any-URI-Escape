NAME
    Any::URI::Escape - Load URI::Escape::XS preferentially over URI::Escape

SYNOPSIS
      use Any::URI::Escape;
      $escaped_url = uri_escape($url);

      # URI::Escape::XS will be used instead of URI::Escape if it is installed.

DESCRIPTION
    URI::Escape is great, but URI::Escape::XS is faster. This module loads
    URI::Escape::XS and imports the two most common methods if XS is
    installed.

    The insides of this module aren't completely shaken out yet, so patches
    welcome.
